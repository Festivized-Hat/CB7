# CB7

#How to run the mod:

Download and unzip the package to RunningWithRifles/media/packages.
Rename package to CB7 (exactly as is, otherwise scripts break from not finding the right folders.)
Open RWR, and run a new campaign with the cb7 mod.


#How to add more things to the mod:

Add files to the folders, as they would belong in the vanilla game. (For example: weapons need a file in weapons, a texture in textures, and a model in models. Optional files in sounds/particles)

Depending on the type of thing you are adding, add your items to the respective cb_all_*** files.
  This makes them appear in the armory.
