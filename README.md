## How to run the mod

Download and unzip the package to RunningWithRifles/media/packages.
Rename package to `CB7` (exactly as is, otherwise scripts break from not finding the right folders.)
Open RWR, and run a new campaign with the cb7 mod.

## How to add more things to the mod

Add files to the folders, as they would belong in the vanilla game. (For example: weapons need a file in weapons, a texture in textures, and a model in models. Optional files in sounds/particles)

Depending on the type of thing you are adding, add your items to the respective `cb_all_***.xml` files.
  This makes them appear in the armory.

## Known problems
Moving while prone periodically teleports the player in the direction they are moving, including through walls.
